I had a California roll and miso soup. That was probably around 4-5 hours before the symptoms started. I didn't eat anything else unusual - just my usual dinner at home. Could that sushi have made me sick? I've never had food poisoning before, so I'm not sure what to expect. The cramping in my stomach is really intense, especially when I have to go to the bathroom. It's been happening about every 30 minutes to an hour.

I'm a software engineer, so I usually have a pretty regular routine. I haven't been around anyone who's sick that I know of. The only other thing is that I've been feeling really tired and weak too. I think it's because I haven't been able to keep much down and I've lost a bit of sleep from all the bathroom trips. Do you think this could be something more serious than just a stomach bug? I'm trying to figure out if I should be worried or if this is just something that will pass in a day or two.", "model_name": "mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct:free", "symptoms_revealed": ["stomach"], "diagnosis_attempts": 0, "session_end": false}

It's a really intense headache on the left side of my head, almost like a throbbing pain. It comes and goes, but it's been persistent. I've also noticed some weird visual stuff\u2014like seeing zigzag lines or flashing lights. It's been really distracting, especially since I work as a software engineer and need to focus on screens all day. Additionally, I've been feeling really tired lately, yawning a lot, and craving specific foods like chocolate. I've also noticed I've been peeing more often than usual.
