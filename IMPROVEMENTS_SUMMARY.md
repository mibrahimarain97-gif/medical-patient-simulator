# Medical Patient Simulator - Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the key improvements made to make the medical patient simulator less rigid, more natural, and better at prioritizing symptoms for accurate diagnosis.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Less Rigid Prompts** ✅
- **Before**: Prompts had strict formatting requirements like "**bold** formatting" and rigid "CRITICAL ROLE-PLAYING RULES"
- **After**: Natural, conversational prompts that focus on character and behavior rather than strict formatting
- **Benefit**: LLMs can act more naturally without worrying about specific formatting requirements

### 2. **Symptom Prioritization** ✅
- **Before**: All symptoms were treated equally, making it hard to identify defining characteristics
- **After**: Symptoms are now categorized into:
  - **Primary symptoms**: Most important/defining symptoms for diagnosis
  - **Secondary symptoms**: Supporting symptoms that may occur but aren't defining
- **Benefit**: Patients will emphasize the most important symptoms, making diagnosis easier

### 3. **Improved Persona Clarity** ✅
- **Before**: Personas had bold formatting and complex instructions
- **After**: Clear, focused personality traits that are easier for LLMs to act out
- **Benefit**: More consistent and believable character behavior

### 4. **Better Symptom Dataset** ✅
- **New file**: `disease_to_symptom_sentences_prioritized.json`
- **Structure**: Each condition now has `primary_symptoms` and `secondary_symptoms` arrays
- **Example - Migraine**:
  - Primary: "throbbing pain on one side of head", "zigzag lines/flashing lights"
  - Secondary: "tiredness", "thirst", "mood changes", etc.

### 5. **Enhanced App Logic** ✅
- **Backward compatibility**: System works with both old and new symptom formats
- **Smart symptom handling**: Automatically detects and uses prioritized symptoms when available
- **Improved MCQ generation**: Questions now focus on primary symptoms for better learning

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **`prompts_and_evaluator.py`**
   - Completely rewrote `build_prompt_template()` function
   - Added symptom prioritization logic
   - Removed rigid formatting requirements

2. **`app.py`**
   - Updated `load_data()` to handle both symptom formats
   - Modified `generate_random_patient()` to use prioritized symptoms
   - Enhanced MCQ generation to focus on primary symptoms
   - Reduced rigidity in diagnosis handling

3. **`personas.json`**
   - Removed bold formatting from personality traits
   - Made traits more specific and actionable for LLMs

4. **`disease_to_symptom_sentences_prioritized.json`** (NEW)
   - Created new prioritized symptom dataset
   - Separated primary vs secondary symptoms for all 15 conditions

### New Features:
- **Automatic format detection**: System automatically detects whether to use old or new symptom format
- **Symptom categorization**: Primary symptoms are emphasized in prompts and MCQs
- **Natural conversation flow**: Less rigid instructions lead to more natural patient responses

## Example of Improvement

### Before (Rigid):
```
**CRITICAL ROLE-PLAYING RULES:**
1. **YOU ARE A REAL PATIENT** - Act exactly like a human patient would
2. **PERSONA CONSISTENCY** - Always express your personality traits naturally in **bold** like **"I'm really worried about this"**
3. **SYMPTOM ACCURACY** - Only mention symptoms from the provided list, put them in quotes like "I have 'fever'"
```

### After (Natural):
```
**HOW TO ACT:**
1. Stay in character as [Name] throughout the conversation
2. Express your personality naturally - show your traits through how you speak and behave
3. Describe your symptoms naturally in conversation, not as a list
4. Use everyday language, not medical terms
```

## Benefits for Medical Training

1. **Better Diagnosis Practice**: Students can now focus on the most important symptoms
2. **More Realistic Patients**: Less rigid prompts lead to more natural patient behavior
3. **Improved Learning**: MCQ questions now focus on defining symptoms rather than random ones
4. **Consistent Experience**: Symptom prioritization ensures key diagnostic features are always present

## Testing

Run `python test_improvements.py` to verify all improvements are working correctly.

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains full backward compatibility with existing symptom datasets while automatically using the improved prioritized version when available.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expand to 50 conditions**: Apply the same prioritization logic to more medical conditions
2. **Dynamic symptom weighting**: Allow symptoms to have different importance levels
3. **Condition-specific prompts**: Customize prompts based on the specific medical condition
4. **Learning analytics**: Track which symptoms students focus on vs. which they miss
